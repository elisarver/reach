Reach gathers urls from a website.

Installation:

I suggest you install [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), and run glide install.

You can use `go get -u github.com/elisarver/reach/cmd/reach` if you're only interested in the executable.

The application displays full usage with the -h flag.
